# Anime grid

Inspired by [Movie Grid](https://moviegrid.io/). I am a software dev and my coworkers are always playing it and it made me feel left out cause I'm not really watching movies like that. So I made a version I could play >:)

Built off the [Anilist API](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs).
