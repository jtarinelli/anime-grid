            <li>Click on a cell to search for an anime that satisfies the clues for that row and column.</li>
            <li>You get nine guesses total, including incorrect ones.</li>
            <li>Make sure you've selected your guess from the dropdown before guessing or it shan't work.</li>
            <li>Correct guesses can't be reused.</li>
            <li>Words are only counted as separate if separated by a space, any other character like a dash doesn't count. For example "Mahou Shoujo Madokaâ˜…Magica" is considered three words.</li>
            <li>Clues relating to anime titles are checked against the romaji version of the Japanese title, plus the official English version if there is one. For example "Kuragehime" counts as a one word title even though the English title "Princess Jellyfish" is two words. If in doubt, both versions are displayed in the dropdown.</li>
