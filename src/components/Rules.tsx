            <li className='mb-2'>Movies are considered incorrect guesses for clues about the number of episodes.</li>
            <li className='mb-2'>Words are only counted as separate if separated by a space, any other character like a dash doesn't count. For example "Mahou Shoujo Madokaâ˜…Magica" is considered three words.</li>
            <li className='mb-2'>Clues relating to anime titles are checked against the romaji version of the Japanese title, plus the official English version if there is one. For example "Kuragehime" counts as a one word title even though the English title "Princess Jellyfish" is two words. If in doubt, both versions are displayed in the dropdown.</li>
